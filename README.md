Application of various Machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of loan default.

# Implementation

1. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/bibek-huma/loan_prediction/blob/master/Loan%20default%20modeling%20using%20logistic%20regression%20.ipynb)
2. [Comparison of algorithms](https://github.com/bibek-huma/loan_prediction/blob/master/Loan%20default%20prediction%20modeling..ipynb)

# If aggregate value of default cases increases upto 25%, immediately trigger an alert to management for refinancing of loans through insured broker agents having a proper valid operating liscence.
